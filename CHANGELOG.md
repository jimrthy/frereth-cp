0.0.1

Have a big portion of the handshake translated and working.

The pieces that get the messages to and from the Children still aren't
fully implemented.

The messaging protocol/prioritization/retry pieces aren't tested at all.

I'm not really ready for any sort of release, but I need to rearrange
the way I'm handling versioning because I'm not happy with the way I'm
not getting SNAPSHOT updates from clojars.
