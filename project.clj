  ;; Q: Could I totally pull datomic dependencies out of everything else
  ;; by putting them in here?
  ;; A: Probably. But it would be a foolish choice. The web and client components
  ;; really shouldn't have access to that sort of thing.
  ;; TODO: Pick a date library and use it.

                 ;; makes the most sense.

                 ;; a local maven repo.
                 ;; It seems like it should really take care of its handler
                 ;; ...except that very likely means native libraries, so
                 ;; it gets more complicated. Still, we shouldn't be worrying
                 ;; about details like jeromq vs jzmq here.
                 ;; Q: Does the reference to this really belong in here?
                 ;; After all, there's a pretty strong chance that "only"
                 ;; server and client will actually use it.
                 ;; Then again, if that happens, web will only inherit
                 ;; this through client. And, if it doesn't, renderer
                 ;; will need this to talk to the stand-alone "client."
                 ;; So the short answer is "Yes"
                 ;; Longer answer is "Do I really want to depend on a native library?"

                 ;; it out for hornetq), but I'm writing an app that needs functionality
                 ;; implemented in here, and I really don't want to install this for it.
