# frereth-cp

CurveCP is a low-level protocol for streaming bytes across
the network, much like TCP. Except in a secure manner.

This is an attempt to translate the reference implementation
into clojure.

## TODO

bootlaces tries to use adzerk.bootlaces.template/update-
dependency to update the version referenced in here.

FIXME: Take advantage of that

## Background

It was initially designed by Daniel J. Bernstein. The spec,
justification, and explanation can be found at
[CurveCP](http://curvecp.org/index.html "Usable
security for the Internet").

## Status

The preliminary translation work is done, though I'm not happy
with it.

Writing C idioms in clojure was a terrible approach.
Now that I understand what's going on, I'm strongly inclined to rewrite
it more idiomatically.

Alternatively, writing low-level networking code in a really high-level
language probably wasn't a great
idea. A pure java implementation seems like it would have been
a much wiser choice.

But, hey, I've taken it this far. And this *does* give me a
higher-level perspective to really think about what's going
on, above and beyond the bit twiddling.

And moving forward into multithreading seems like it should be very
natural.

So...maybe.

## Usage

Although you probably don't want to actually use it yet.

### Maven Coordinates

    [com.frereth/cp "current version"]

### Docker creation

    docker build -t frereth/curve-cp .

### Local Installation

    boot install

### Publish to clojars

#### From the master branch

    boot set-version javac build-jar push-release

This should be the same as

    boot to-clojars

TODO: Verify that.

##### Release Versions

    git tag major.minor.patch

Then push the release as described immediately above.

Right now, this will trigger a warning that the tag already exists.

This is something else that needs more hammock time.

#### From a working branch

    boot publish-from-branch

### REPL connection

    M-x cider-jack-in

(or whatever the equivalent is for your editor of choice) should
probably work fine for most people.

If you'd rather do it the old-fashioned way, for whatever reason:

    bash> ./boot.sh cider-repl

then connect to nrepl over port 32767.

NOTE: Currently, the REPL starts with an error about "No namespace:
reply.eval-modes.nrepl found." This is a nuisance issue with one of
Boot 2.8.2's dependencies.

It's fixed in Boot 2.8.3, but I've had issues pushing updates.

So, for now, just ignore the warning.



## Notes

### Line numbers in comments

A lot of comments reference line numbers. Those really point
back to the reference implementation, from
https://github.com/krig/nacl

### tweetnacl

Having the tweetnacl java source just copy/pasted in the middle
breaks every linter I've tried to use. It seems like that part
really needs to be published somewhere as its own library.

Then again, maybe not. Maybe that violates the entire point
behind using tweetnacl.
