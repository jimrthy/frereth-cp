CurveCP is a low-level protocol for streaming bytes across
the network, much like TCP.

The fact that it's built on top of UDP datagram packets
may be ironic, since my major use case is an exchange
of small message packets.

That's really just a detail of this particular implementation,
though.

The basic idea has the potential for much broader general
appeal.
