  "Communicate among 0mq sockets and async channels.

Strongly inspired by lynaghk's zmq-async

Not sure how much sense ever made in the first place.

It definitely seems to run against the grain of netty/aleph

Keeping it around as/for reference for now, but it really
should just go away if/when I decide to really move forward
with this branch."
