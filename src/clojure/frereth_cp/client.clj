  "Implement the client half of the CurveCP protocol.

  It seems like it would be nice if I could just declare
  the message exchange, but that approach gets complicated
  on the server side. At least half the point there is
  reducing DoS.

  This really doesn't seem to belong in here. I keep going
  back and forth about that. It seems like it would be
  cleaner to move this into the frereth.client, and the
  server component into frereth.server.

  But that makes it much more difficult to test."

The current implementation is based on the assumption that cookie-packet
is either a byte stream or a byte array.

And that I can just write the response byte-buffer back to the output
stream.

That assumption does not seem valid at all.

I have to have an address/port destination so the stream can know
where to route the message.

According to the Aleph docs, cookie-packet really should be a map that
includes :address and :port keys, along with the :message value which is
the actual byte-array (ByteBuf?).

That's what I've set up the server side to send, so that's what I'm
currently receiving here.

TODO: Need to validate that assumption.

To make matters worse, this entire premise is built around side-effects.

We send a request to the agent in wrapper to update its state with the
Vouch, based on the cookie packet. Then we do another send to get it to
send the vouch

This matches the original implementation, but it seems like a really
terrible approach in an environment that's intended to multi-thread."

But not quite, since it's really the first in a chain of side-effects.

Q: Is there something equivalent I can set up using core.async?

Actually, this seems to be screaming to be rewritten on top of manifold
Deferreds.

For that matter, it seems like setting up a watch on an atom that's
specifically for something like this might make a lot more sense.

That way I wouldn't be trying to multi-purpose communications channels.

OTOH, they *are* the trigger for this sort of thing.

The reference implementation mingles networking with this code.
That seems like it might make sense as an optimization,
but not until I have convincing numbers that it's needed.
Of course, I might also be opening things up for something
like a timing attack."
